# Contributing to FrontEnd Grimoire

Hey you!!! Yes you... thanks for taking the time to dig with us! ❤️

You're encouraged to bring your pickaxe, shovel or even punch them rocks with your bare hands. You can look here if you're lost [Magic spells glossary](#table-of-contents), and for you folks out there with a different kind of thought i dunno, maybe you wanna dig another kind of rock
, you can find a section in this sea of words that can help you comunicate with us, we speak english but only a litle, our main language is giberish, anyaways the dwarfs are eager to hear what you have to say. 🎉

> Well, if you find it hard to live inside a rock and fight goblins while digging some gold, you can enchant us with these spells down here, we would really apreciate it:
> - Star the project (Please dont aim it at our heads is pointy)
> - Tweet about it (They say it gives you blessings and can also give a great deal of distress, anyways i like gambling so this spell is very welcomed)
> - Refer this project in your project's readme (I'd like someone to remenber all the stupid stuff i did in life)
> - Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues (If you want them to visit, dont forget to wear a helmet)

## Code of Conduct

ANOTHER BOOK, this one tells you to not screw around with mermaids and stuff, i tried to read it once but fell asleep, i'm sure theres something important there:
[FrontEnd Grimoire Code of Conduct](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/FrontEnd-Grimoireblob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
If you see someone acting like a goblin you can contact one of the dwarfs in the cave.

## I Have a Question

> If you have a question you can contact us any time of the day, if we make a strange face i advise you to look at the wizards college -> [Google](google.com).

Before making a question, its adviced you look into our board of [Issues](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/FrontEnd-Grimoire/issues), We also have some goblin hunting missions there. In case you have found a issue, go tell your mother... just kidding write us a letter there and we'll look into it.

If you got here and sill need some advice, we could give you some potions in the future:

- Write us a [Letter](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/FrontEnd-Grimoire/issues/new).
- Tells us how you feel about it in details, this is important sice dwarfs dont have compassion and we may find it dificult to understand emotions.
- 
## I WANT TO DIG A HOLE

> ### Bullsh*t Notice <!-- omit in toc -->
> When inside the hole, all of the gold found by you is your own responsibility, it will be ruled by our project license and god forbids ... The law.

### Reporting Bugs And Goblins

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

If you leave a mission with no details i will personally come to your house have dinner with your wife, take the time to fill in all the info need to complete it. PLease follow these steps so your mission is completed sucesfuly

- Make sure that you are using a good pen.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not someone dressed as one e.g. If you feel the need to go drink some tea with us go here -> [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- Check the mission board to see if there are any missions like yours [bug tracker](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/FrontEnd-Grimoireissues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure you have searched the wizards tower [Google](google.com), they might have already done it or have some advice.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for FrontEnd Grimoire, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/FrontEnd-Grimoire) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/FrontEnd-Grimoire/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/FrontEnd-Grimoire/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most FrontEnd Grimoire users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->
