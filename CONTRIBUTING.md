#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

> Embarking on a bug-hunting mission requires precision and diligence. Before unleashing your findings upon the dwarven council, take heed of these sacred instructions:

##### 🌌 Preparing for the Quest:

- **🖊️ Equip a Mighty Pen:** *Ensure your writing tool rivals a dwarven warhammer. A reliable pen leaves no room for ambiguity in your scrolls.*
- **🐜 Bug or Mere Disguise? Verify:**: *Distinguish true bugs from impostors! If in doubt, consult the [I Have a Question](#i-have-a-question) oracle for a tea session.*
- **📋 Check the Mission Board:** *Explore the [bug tracker](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/FrontEnd-Grimoireissues?q=label%3Abug) for kin with similar quests. Unity in mission brings strength.*

### 🚀 Suggesting Enhancements: Forging New Horizons 🚀

Venture forth, intrepid coder, into the realms of enhancement suggestion! Whether crafting entirely new features or refining existing enchantments, this passage illuminates the path to contribute to the evolution of FrontEnd Grimoire.

<a id="your-first-code-contribution"></a>
#### 🌌 Before Submitting an Enhancement: A Prelude to Enchantment 🌌

- **📖 Codex of Wisdom:** *Immerse yourself in the [documentation](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/FrontEnd-Grimoire). Ascertain if the realms of your envisioned enhancement are already charted within these sacred scrolls.*
- **🔍 Scrolls of Recognition:** *Traverse the [Issues board](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/FrontEnd-Grimoire/issues). Ascertain whether the enhancement has been summoned before. If so, add your insights to the existing summoning rather than conjuring a new one.*
- **🌐 Project's True North:** *Align your enhancement with the grand tapestry of FrontEnd Grimoire. Seek whether your mystical addition resonates with the project's scope and aspirations. Craft a compelling case to persuade the developers of its magical merits.*
- **🌟 Universal Appeal:** *Envision enhancements that illuminate the path for the majority of our users. Remember, we seek features that bring magic to the masses. If your vision caters to a minority, consider weaving it into an add-on or a magical plugin library.*

#### 🌌 How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion? 🌟

##### [GitHub issues](https://github.com/MOB-atheist/FrontEnd-Grimoire/issues). *The sacred scrolls where enhancement suggestions take form. Navigate this portal to witness the tapestry of ideas and contribute your own enchantments.*

- **🌟 Title Incantation:** *Bestow upon your enhancement suggestion a title of clarity and enchantment. Let it resonate with the magic it promises.*
- **🗺️ Path of Illumination:** *Unveil the suggestion with a detailed description. Chart a step-by-step path through the mystical enhancement, revealing its secrets like a guide through the enchanted forest.*
- **⚙️ Current vs. Envisioned Realms:** *Paint a vivid portrait of the existing behavior and articulate the transformation you seek. Explain the expected behavior, and why it resonates more profoundly with your vision. Illuminate the alternatives that failed to conjure the desired magic.*
- **📸 Visual Glyphs (Optional):** *If the arcane arts permit, include visual glyphs such as screenshots or animated GIFs. Use tools like  [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) for macOS and Windows, or [Silentcast](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) and [Byzanz](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) for Linux to capture the essence of your enchantment.*
- **🤔 Utility to the Many:** *Articulate the essence of why this enhancement is not merely a whim but a profound boon to the majority of FrontEnd Grimoire users. Illuminate the path by showcasing projects that have mastered similar magic, serving as beacons of inspiration.*
